      <h2>Historical Background</h2>
      <p>
        Mormon pioneers established Provo as a permanent settlement in 1849. It became the second largest city in the
        territory until Ogden became a major railroad hub in the 1870s. In 1875, the settlers established Brigham Young
        Academy, the beginnings of today’s Brigham Young University. Attracting national attention for both its academic
        and athletic programs, it is the largest church-affiliated institution of higher learning in the nation today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the city’s history, Provo has served as Utah Valley’s center of industry, commerce, and government.
        One bustling example is the Provo Woolen Mills. Since sheep thrived in Utah’s climate and a mill site was
        readily available on the Provo River to supply water and power to a plant, the Provo Woolen Mills opened in 1872
        as Utah’s first large factory. The LDS Church and private donations paid for its construction and upon
        completion, it employed upwards of 150 people. Many of its workers were skilled immigrant laborers from British
        textile factories. Later, the Provo factory turned to young women to run the looms. It specialized in heavy
        woolens; blankets, shawls, yarns, and flannels with about one-third of them being exported. The Provo Woolen
        Mills experienced ebbs and flows, continuing to operate until 1932.
